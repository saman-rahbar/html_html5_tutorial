<!-- Creating a cat photo app-->
<h1>Hello World</h1>
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<!--P elements are the preferred elements for paragraph texts on different websites
    p is short for paragraph-->

<!-- <p>I'm a p tag</p> -->

<!-- Web developers usually use lorem ipsum text as placeholder text-->
<p>Kitty ipsum text</p>
<!-- So our phone does not have enough vertical space se we have to remove some elements and we do that 
        by commenting out the hello world piece :) -->

<!-- In order for the search engine and other developers easier find the main content 
    of our website we have another tag called main. We can tag the main paragraph
    in our website in a way that is shown below: -->
<main>
    <p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, 
     shed everywhere rip the couch sleep in the sink fluffy fur catnip scratched.</p>
</main>
