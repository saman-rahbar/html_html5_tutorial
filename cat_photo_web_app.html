<!-- Creating a cat photo app-->
<h1>Hello World</h1>
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<!--P elements are the preferred elements for paragraph texts on different websites
    p is short for paragraph-->

<!-- <p>I'm a p tag</p> -->

<!-- Web developers usually use lorem ipsum text as placeholder text-->
<p>Kitty ipsum text</p>
<!-- So our phone does not have enough vertical space se we have to remove some elements and we do that 
        by commenting out the hello world piece :) -->
