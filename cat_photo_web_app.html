<!-- Creating a cat photo app-->
<h1>Hello World</h1>
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<!--P elements are the preferred elements for paragraph texts on different websites
    p is short for paragraph-->

<!-- <p>I'm a p tag</p> -->

<!-- Web developers usually use lorem ipsum text as placeholder text-->
<p>Kitty ipsum text</p>
<!-- So our phone does not have enough vertical space se we have to remove some elements and we do that 
        by commenting out the hello world piece :) -->

<!-- In order for the search engine and other developers easier find the main content 
    of our website we have another tag called main. We can tag the main paragraph
    in our website in a way that is shown below: -->
<main>
    <p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, 
     shed everywhere rip the couch sleep in the sink fluffy fur catnip scratched.</p>
</main>

<!--There is another tag which would allow you to import image files. When adding images to a website it
    's always a good idea to use "alt" attribute which would describe what the image is all about in case
    image fails to load -->

<img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute kitty relaxing!"> 

<!-- Note: When using img tag we don't need to add the closing tag-->
<!-- Note2: The value of the "alt" attribute should not have any speciall character-->

<!-- We can use the "anchor" tag which starts with "a" to give a name to a link, like a hyperlink-->
<a href="http://freecatphotoapp.com">Cat Photos</a>

<!-- Opening a link in a new window by using the "target attribute":-->
<a href="http://freecatphotoapp.com" target="_blank">cat photos</a>

<!-- We can link to an internal link on a website.
    In order to do that we need to assign a link's hread attribute to a 
    hash symbole # plus the value of the id attribute for the element we want 
    to internally link to:-->

<a href="#footer">Jump to Footer</a>
<footer id = "footer">Cooyright Cat Photo App</footer>
